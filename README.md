## Stick-Slip Model

The [stick-slip phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stick%E2%80%93slip_phenomenon) is observed in various mechanical systems involving friction. 
The simulation models a mass connected to a spring connected to an external surface under relative velocity, subject to both static and kinetic friction.

The first picture shows the displacement $x$ of the mass. Starting from a relaxed spring, $x$ inceases linearly until the slipping condition $|F_{\text{Hook}}| > F_{\text{max}}$ is met. The mass subsequently *sticks* and *slips*.
